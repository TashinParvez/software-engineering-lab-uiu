---

### 3. Stage and Commit Changes

### 4. Create and Switch to a New Branch

### 5. Push Changes to a Remote Repository

**Task:** Push your current branch to a remote repository with alias `origin` and branch `main`.
**Command:**

```bash
git push origin main
```

##### Notes:

1. If this is your **first push** and the remote branch doesnâ€™t exist yet, you may need:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

- `-u` sets `origin/main` as the **upstream** for your local `main` branch.
- Later, you can simply do `git push` without specifying the branch.

2. If youâ€™re pushing a **new branch**, replace `main` with your branch name:

```bash
git push -u origin feature-xyz
```
